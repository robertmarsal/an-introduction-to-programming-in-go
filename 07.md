**1. `sum` is a function which takes a slice of numbers and adds them together.
What would its function signature look like in Go?**

```go
sum(nums []int) int
```

**2. Write a function which takes an integer and halves it and returns `true` if 
it was even or `false` if it was odd. For example `half(1)` should return `(0, false)`
and `half(2)` should return `(1, true)`.**

**3. Write a function with one variadic parameter that finds the greates number in a
list of numbers.**

**4. Using `makeEvenGenerator` as an example, write a `makeOddGenerator` function that
generates odd numbers.**  

**5. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: `fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.
Write a recursive function which can find `fib(n)`.**  

**6. What are defer, panic and recover? How do you recover from a run-time panic?**
