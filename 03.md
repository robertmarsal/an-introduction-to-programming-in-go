**1. How are integers stored on a computer?**  
**2. We know that (in base 10) the largest 1 digit number is 9 and the largest 2 digit number is 99.
Given that in binary the largest 2 digit number is 11 (3), the largest 3 digit number is 111 (7) and
the largest 4 digit number is 1111 (15) what's the largest 8 digit number?**  
**3. Although overpowered for the task you can use Go as a calculator. Write a program that computes
`321325 x 424521` and prints it to the terminal. (Use the `*` operator for multiplication)**  
**4. What is a string? How do you find its length?**  
**5. What's the value of the expression `(true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false)`?**
