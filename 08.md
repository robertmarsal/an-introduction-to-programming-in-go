**1. How do you get the memory address of a variable?**  

**2. How do you assign a value to a pointer?**  

**3. How do you create a new pointer?**  

**4. What is the value of `x` after running this program:**
```go
func square(x *float64) {
    *x = *x * *x
}
func main() {
    x := 1.5
    square(&x)
}
```

**5. Write a program that can swap two integers `(x :=1; y := 2; swap(&x, &y)` should give you
`x=2` and `y=1`).**
